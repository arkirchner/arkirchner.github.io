Hi, my name is Armin Kirchner. I am German, and I have been living in Japan
since 2014.

Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer. Since 2010, I have specialized in creating web 
applications with the Ruby on Rails framework. My current role as a senior 
software engineer at Yamap focuses on the GraphQL and REST API backend.

Since joining [Yamap](https://yamap.com), I have been able to specialize in 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). For the
[outdoor climbing application Yamap](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/yamap-%E3%83%A4%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-%E7%99%BB%E5%B1%B1%E5%9C%B0%E5%9B%B3%E3%82%A2%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA-%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A9%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86/id558780450)
, I introduced custom vector tile maps and a special data model using PostGIS.

My infra work includes deploying and monitoring applications from single server 
deployments to Kubernetes clusters with many applications.

I have experience with React and Hotwire on the front end.
